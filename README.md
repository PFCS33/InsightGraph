## Function Description

## Function Description

- Complete the visualization of the **numerical** configuration of the D3 force directed graph
  - You can have a quick view of almost all the API of D3's directed force graph over there.
    - Base on the official Documentation: https://d3js.org/d3-force
- Complete the visualization of the **numerical** configuration of the D3 force directed graph

  - You can have a quick view of almost all the API of D3's directed force graph over there.

    - Base on the official Documentation: https://d3js.org/d3-force

  - the params which can be set as a function is marked by \*

- embed the **Vega-Lite graph** in the circle of D3 force directed graph
  - you can click **circles** to toggle the display of Vega-Lite graphs
  - Note: add collision force will look better (which is not set by default config of project)
